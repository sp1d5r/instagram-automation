# Instagram automation 

Instagram automation software, this is part two of the [Instamation](https://github.com/sp1d5r/InstaMation) program i made. 
Published on heroku this time, using React and Django.

You should be able to see the webpage [here](http://instamation.herokuapp.com)

But if you want to set up on your local machine follow the below [Installation guide](#installation---ubuntumac).


### Installation - (Ubuntu/MAC)

(1) Setting up with ./setup.sh  (or ./setup-mac.sh for MAC) 
* Navigate to project directory 
* Give appropriate permissions to the ./setup.sh file 
```shell
chmod + x setup.sh
```
* run the file (Ubuntu)
```shell 
  ./setup.sh 
```
* run the file (Mac)
```shell 
  ./setup-mac.sh 
```

If that doesn't work, setup using normal way. Go into the relevant setup.sh file and run commands manually, consider 
using sudo (root) if that doesn't work.
